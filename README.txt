This is an implementation of the memcached protocol purely in python.
It provides the text protocol only.  It works over TCP connections
only.  It gives a reasonably true protocol implementation, but it 
provides stats a bit differently than the original, and the verbose
option does nothing.  Run it with the -h option to see what the
command-line options are.

Have fun!
